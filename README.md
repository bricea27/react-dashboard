## Using this simple weather & inspirational quote dashboard.

### About
This is a minimalistic weather app with a twist. It displays the weather for a specific location (pulled from the Google Places API), using the https://darksky.net/dev API, as well as a funny, inspirational quote, with a personal touch, pulled from the Chuck Norris Internet Database (https://www.icndb.com/api/).

The background gradient featured on the dashboard represents an HSL value of both the high and low temperatures, where the hue represents the temperature, and the saturation represents the cloud coverage.
